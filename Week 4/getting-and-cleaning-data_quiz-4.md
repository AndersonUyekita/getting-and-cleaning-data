# Data Cleaning
df_gdp_tidy <- df_gdp %>%
    mutate(US.dollars. = sub(pattern = " ", replacement = "", x = US.dollars.)) %>%
    mutate(US.dollars. = gsub(pattern = ",", replacement = "", x = US.dollars.)) %>%
    mutate(gdp = as.numeric(US.dollars.)) %>%
    mutate(ranking = as.numeric(Ranking)) %>%
    select(-c(X.1, X.2, X.3, X.4, X.5, X.6)) %>%
    na.omit() %>%
    rename("CountryName" = Economy)
```

After the data manipulation, I have calculated the GDP average as
follows:

``` r
# Calculating the GDP Average
mean(df_gdp_tidy$gdp, na.rm = TRUE)
```

    ## [1] 377652.4

## Question 3

The pattern used to filter countries that start with “United” is:
`^United`.

``` r
# Readings: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html
#    ^ to match the start of the string.
#
# Solution 1:
grep(pattern = "^United", x = df_gdp_tidy$CountryName)
```

    ## [1]  1  6 32

``` r
# Solution 2:
df_gdp_tidy %>% filter(grepl(pattern = "^United", x = CountryName))
```

    ##     X Ranking          CountryName US.dollars.      gdp ranking
    ## 1 USA       1        United States   16244600  16244600       1
    ## 2 GBR       6       United Kingdom    2471784   2471784       6
    ## 3 ARE      32 United Arab Emirates     348595    348595      32

Both solutions have the same 3 countries, which starts with the United.

Moreover, data from 1999 onward for Serbia for most indicators exclude data for Kosovo, 1999 being the year when Kosovo became a territory under international administration pursuant to UN Security Council Resolution 1244 (1999); any exceptions are noted. Kosovo became a World Bank member on June 29, 2009; available data are shown separately for Kosovo.

Counting the number of countries.

## Question 5

Executing the given code:

``` r
# Loading the quantmod package
library(quantmod)

# Gathering data from Amazon.
amzn = getSymbols("AMZN",auto.assign=FALSE)

# Gathering the dates from each data.
sampleTimes = index(amzn)
```

I have converted it into a tibble dataframe to be able to use the
tidyverse package.

``` r
# Converting the amzn object into Tibble.
data_q5 <- as_tibble(amzn)

# Adding the date column.
data_q5['date'] <- sampleTimes

# Filtering data only from 2012.
data_q5_2012 <- data_q5 %>%
    filter(date >= "2012-01-01" & date <= "2012-12-31")

# Showing the data gathered.
DT::datatable(data_q5_2012)

The number of observations in 2012:

``` r
# How many values in 2012
nrow(data_q5_2012)
```

    ## [1] 250

I have used the Lubridate package to work with a date type. In addition,
I have added a column to store the wee day.

``` r
# Ensuring to show the Week days in English.s
Sys.setlocale("LC_ALL","English")
```

    ## [1] "LC_COLLATE=English_United States.1252;LC_CTYPE=English_United States.1252;LC_MONETARY=English_United States.1252;LC_NUMERIC=C;LC_TIME=English_United States.1252"

``` r
# Adding a new column to store the wee days.
data_q5_2012_wdays <- data_q5_2012 %>%
    mutate(wday = lubridate::wday(x = lubridate::ymd(date), label=TRUE))

# Showing the data with the new column of week day.
DT::datatable(data_q5_2012_wdays)
```
